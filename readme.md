4. That's all! Now you can enjoy using InstaSwap!

## Usage

Using InstaSwap is as easy as child's play. All you need to do is a few clicks of the mouse. In Stable Diffusion, face swapping can be done using two different methods: Text To Image and Image To Image. Below, you can find detailed instructions on how to perform a face swap using these methods.

<img src="https://github.com/abdozmantar/StableDiffusion-InstaSwap/blob/main/help/usage.png?raw=true" alt="webui-demo" width="100%"/>

### Text To Image
In the Text to Image method, first write a detailed description of the character you want in the prompt section*(1). Continue creating images by pressing the Generate button until you get the desired result. If you have achieved the result you want, to ensure you donâ€™t lose it, click green fixed seed button*(2) and set your seed number to text box.

<img src="https://github.com/abdozmantar/StableDiffusion-InstaSwap/blob/main/help/text2img1.jpg?raw=true" alt="webui-demo" width="100%"/>

Then, we can activate InstaSwap and setup it. Turn on the Enable checkbox *(3). Now, click on the source image panel  *(4) below and select the target face you want to change. This can be any image file.

<img src="https://github.com/abdozmantar/StableDiffusion-InstaSwap/blob/main/help/text2img2.jpg?raw=true" alt="webui-demo" width="100%"/>

Now, finally, press the Generate*(5) button again and voila! Your face swapping process is successfully completed. That's how easy it is to do a face swap with InstaSwap.

### Image To Image
In the Image to Image method, we aim to change the face in an already existing image. Therefore, after selecting our source image, we leave the prompt section empty without writing anything. The settings in InstaSwap are the same as in the Text to Image section above. Just enabling it and select your target face image. The important thing to note here is that to achieve the same result, we need to set the denoising strength in Stable Diffusion to a value of zero. Otherwise, the image we selected will undergo changes. After completing all the steps, press the 'Generate' button and the result will be in front of you in couple of secods !

### Restoration
After the face swapping process, the resulting image can sometimes be of low resolution. To prevent this and achieve ultra-high-quality results, we can utilize Face Restoration model. All you need to do is select your desired restorer from the restore face panel.

<img src="https://github.com/abdozmantar/StableDiffusion-InstaSwap/blob/main/help/restore.jpg?raw=true" alt="webui-demo" width="100%"/>

### Gender Detection

You have the ability to designate a specific gender for detection in images. InstaSwap will only execute a face swap if the detected face fulfills this specified condition

### Face Indexes

InstaSwap identifies faces within images sequentially, starting from left to right and then from top to bottom. To target specific faces, you have the option to assign indexes to both source and input images. The indexing begins with 0 for the first face detected. You are free to arrange the indexes in your preferred sequence. For example, using 0,1,2 for the Source and 1,0,2 for the Input indicates that the face at index 1 in the Input image (the second face) will swap with the face at index 0 in the Source image (the first face), and so on.

### Api
You have the option to utilize InstaSwap either through the integrated Webui API or by using an external API. For detailed instructions, please refer to the information provided on this [page](https://github.com/abdozmantar/StableDiffusion-InstaSwap/blob/main/api.md)

## Troubleshooting

### **I. "You should at least have one model in models directory"**

Ensure that the "inswapper_128.onnx" model is located in the correct directory. It should be placed within the `stable-diffusion-webui\models\insightface` folder. If the model is located elsewhere, transfer it to this specified folder.

### **II. Any problems with installing Insightface or other dependencies**
If installation problems persist despite having VS C++ Build Tools or MS VS 2022, proceed with the following steps:
1.  Shut down your SD WebUI Server and then restart it. For users of any operating system, if the issue remains unresolved, follow these steps:
2.  If your SD WebUI Server is operational, close it.
3.  Navigate to the `venv\Lib\site-packages` directory on Windows or `venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages` on MacOS/Linux.
4.  Look for and delete any folders beginning with `~`, like `~rotobuf`.
5.  Proceed to `venv\Scripts` on Windows or `venv/bin` on MacOS/Linux.
6.  Open a Terminal or Console (cmd) in that directory and enter `activate`.
7.  First, update pip: execute `pip install -U pip`.
8.  Install the following packages one at a time:
    -   `pip install insightface==0.7.3`
    -   `pip install onnx`
    -   `pip install "onnxruntime-gpu>=1.16.1"`
    -   `pip install opencv-python`
    -   `pip install tqdm`
9.  After typing `deactivate`, you can close your Terminal or Console. Restart your SD WebUI. If ReActor still does not function correctly, please report it in the Issues section.

### **III. "TypeError: UpscaleOptions.init() got an unexpected keyword argument 'do_restore_first'"**

To address this issue, begin by deactivating all Roop-based extensions, except for the one in question:
-   Navigate to the 'Extensions -> Installed' section and deselect all Roop-based extensions apart from the relevant one.
-   Then, select 'Apply and restart UI'.

### **IV. "AttributeError: 'FaceSwapScript' object has no attribute 'enable'"**

This error is likely due to a conflict with another extension, such as "SD-CN-Animation." To resolve it:

-   Disable the "SD-CN-Animation" extension, or any other extension that might be causing the conflic

### **V. "INVALID_PROTOBUF : Load model from <...>\models\insightface\inswapper_128.onnx failed:Protobuf parsing failed" OR "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'get'" OR "AttributeError: 'FaceSwapScript' object has no attribute 'save_original'"**

This issue might arise from a problem with the model file `inswapper_128.onnx`. To address this, manually download the file from the provided [link](https://github.com/facefusion/facefusion-assets/releases/download/models/inswapper_128.onnx) and put it to the `stable-diffusion-webui\models\insightface` replacing existing one. Once downloaded, place it in the `stable-diffusion-webui\models\insightface` directory, replacing the existing file


### **VI. "ValueError: This ORT build has ['TensorrtExecutionProvider', 'CUDAExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider'] enabled" OR "ValueError: This ORT build has ['AzureExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider'] enabled"**

To address these errors, follow these steps:
1.  Shut down your SD WebUI Server if it's currently running.
2.  In Windows, navigate to `venv\Lib\site-packages`, or on MacOS/Linux, go to `venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages`. Look for and delete any folders starting with "~", such as "~rotobuf".
3.  In Windows, open `venv\Scripts`, or on MacOS/Linux, go to `venv/bin`. Launch Terminal or Console (cmd) in this directory and type `activate`.
4.  Then execute the following commands:
    -   `python -m pip install -U pip`
    -   `pip uninstall -y onnxruntime onnxruntime-gpu onnxruntime-silicon onnxruntime-extensions`
    -   `pip install "onnxruntime-gpu>=1.16.1"`

If the problem persists, it may be due to another extension that automatically reinstalls `onnxruntime` whenever SD WebUI checks for requirements. Check your list of extensions. Some may cause `onnxruntime-gpu` to be downgraded to `onnxruntime<1.16.1` each time SD WebUI is launched. Avoid installing ORT 1.16.0 as it contains a known bug (see [GitHub Issue #17631](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/issues/17631)).

### **VII. "ImportError: cannot import name 'builder' from 'google.protobuf.internal'"**

1.  If your SD WebUI Server is operational, shut it down.
2.  Navigate to `venv\Lib\site-packages` on Windows or `venv/lib/python3.10/site-packages` on MacOS/Linux. Look for and delete any folders that begin with "~" (such as "~rotobuf").
3.  Inside the `site-packages` folder, locate the "google" folder and remove any folders within it that start with "~".
4.  Access `venv\Scripts` on Windows or `venv/bin` on MacOS/Linux, open a Terminal or Console (cmd) there, and enter `activate`.
5.  Execute the following commands:
    -   Update pip: `python -m pip install -U pip`
    -   Uninstall protobuf: `pip uninstall protobuf`
    -   Install a specific version of protobuf: `pip install "protobuf>=3.20.3"`

If these steps don't resolve the issue, it's possible that another extension is causing a conflict by installing an incompatible version of protobuf during SD WebUI's startup requirements check.


### **VIII. (For Windows users) If you still cannot build Insightface for some reasons or just don't want to install Visual Studio or VS C++ Build Tools - do the following:**

1.  If your SD WebUI Server is running, close it.
2.  Download the [prebuilt Insightface package](https://github.com/Gourieff/sd-webui-reactor/raw/main/example/insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl) and place it in the root folder of stable-diffusion-webui (or SD.Next), where the "webui-user.bat" file is located, or (for A1111 Portable) where the "run.bat" file is.
3.  Open CMD in the stable-diffusion-webui (or SD.Next) root folder and execute `.\venv\Scripts\activate`, or (for A1111 Portable) simply run CMD.
4.  Update your PIP: run `python -m pip install -U pip` in the standard environment, or `system\python\python.exe -m pip install -U pip` for A1111 Portable.
5.  Install Insightface: use the command `pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl` for the standard setup, or `system\python\python.exe -m pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl` for A1111 Portable.
